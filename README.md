# plant-disease-detection
In this project, I created a Convolutional Neural Network which predicts whether a plant is suffering from a disease. 

I used different layers and other hyperparameters for building, training and testing this classification model. 

## Steps
1. Mounting google drive on collab notebook.
2. Visualizing the images that we will be working on.
3. Finding out the mean of the dimensions and resizing all images accordingly.
4. Converting the images intoa  numpy array and normalize them. 
5. Checking class imabalance.
6. Splitting the data and performing one-hot encoding.
7. Creating the model architecture, compiling the model and then fitting it. 
8. Plotting the accuracy and loss against each epoch. 
9. Pre-processing the test data and make predictions on it. 
10. Visualize the original and predicted labels for the test images. 

## Technology
1. Python
2. Tensorflow
3. Keras
